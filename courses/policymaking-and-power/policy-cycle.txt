Laswell's Policy Cycle

Pros: 
  Normative model
  Subcategories allow for in-depth analysis of different policy steps (e.g. implementation, agenda setting)
  Implementation was identified as a crucial step to policy evaluation due to the framework of analysis established
  
Cons:
  Assumes causal relationships
  Unempirical
  Assumes linear feedback, where empirical studies observe a feedback loop
  The cycle often starts and stops arbitrarily (does not always begin at agenda setting and end at evaluation)
